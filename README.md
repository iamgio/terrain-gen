# terrain-gen

A terrain generation attempt, visualized with p5.js in 3D WebGL mode.

- Changing parameters in `generator.js` modifies the generated terrain.  
- Changing constants in `terrain-gen.js` alters the visual properties of the final output, such as show/hide wireframe, show/hide colors, tile density and more.
